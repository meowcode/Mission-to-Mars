# Mission-to-Mars

After creating a web app to show uodatedinformation on Mars, images of Mar's hemispheres were scraped and added to the app. To do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
